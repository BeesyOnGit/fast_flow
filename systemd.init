o fix the "Unit watcher.service could not be found" error, you need to create and enable a systemd service for your watcher application. Here's how to do it step by step:

1. Create a systemd Service File
Create a new service file at /etc/systemd/system/watcher.service:

bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/watcher.service
Paste the following configuration (adjust paths as needed):

ini
[Unit]
Description=Watcher Background Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/watcher procede
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Key Settings:
Type=simple â†’ Runs as a foreground process (use forking if your app daemonizes itself).

Restart=always â†’ Auto-restarts if the process crashes.

User=root â†’ Runs as root (change to a less privileged user if possible).

ExecStart â†’ Must point to your watcher binary.

2. Reload systemd & Start the Service
bash
# Reload systemd to detect the new service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start watcher

# Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable watcher

# Check status (should now show as active)
sudo systemctl status watcher
3. Verify Logs
If your app logs to a file (/tmp/watcher_counter.log), check it:

bash
tail -f /tmp/watcher_counter.log
Or use journalctl for systemd logs:

bash
sudo journalctl -u watcher -f
4. Common Fixes
If the service fails:

Check Executable Path:

bash
ls -l /usr/local/bin/watcher  # Ensure binary exists and is executable
Debug Mode:

bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/watcher procede  # Run manually to check for errors
Permissions:

bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/watcher
5. (Optional) Alternative: Run as Non-Root User
For security, avoid running as root:

Create a dedicated user:

bash
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false watcheruser
Update service file (User=watcheruser).

Ensure log files are writable:

bash
sudo chown watcheruser /tmp/watcher_counter.log
Final Notes
Logging: Redirect logs to /var/log/watcher.log for better management.

PID File: If using /tmp/watcher.pid, ensure the service user has write permissions.

Dependencies: If your app needs network/database access, add After=postgresql.service (for example) in the [Unit] section.

Now sudo systemctl status watcher should show the service as active (running). ðŸš€
